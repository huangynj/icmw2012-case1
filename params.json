{"google":"","body":"Case leaders: Wojciech Grabowski (NCAR/MMM) and Zach Lebo (NCAR/ASP) \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this case is to compare approaches to simulate evolution of CCN characteristics due to activation/coalescence scavenging in marine stratocumulus. Activation/coalescence scavenging was indicated as a possible factor in observed transitions from closed to open cell circulation patterns, but computational approaches to cope with CCN processing are rare and untested.\r\n\r\nThis case will include a kinematic setup where computational schemes can be compared without impacts on cloud dynamics, as well as a dynamic model setup suitable for 2D/3D model simulations. A benchmark solution will be provided for the kinematic case applying 2D warm-rain bin microphysics. ","note":"Don't delete this file!
